# Housing-Price-Prediction
A regression problem related to predicting the price of a house based on various given features. Data cleaning methods were used to drop features having more than 40% null values. The null values of features having numeric data type were filled with '0' and those with non-numeric data type were filled with 'None'. Applied One-Hot Encoding to the training and test dataset simultaneously, as it contained a number of categorical features. Trained and developed Linear Regression algorithm after segregating the dataset post One-Hot encoding. Parameter tuning was also done for the model.
